  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Aborisade Kikioriire</strong>. I was born on March 26, 2007, in Ile-Ife, Osun State, Nigeria, where I grew up and started school at OAU Staff School before moving on to OAU International School.</p>
  
  <p>I'm currently a <strong>Software Engineering student</strong> at <strong>Abiola Ajimobi Technical University</strong>, Ibadan, on a scholarship. Along the way, I served as the <strong>Public Relations Officer (PRO)</strong> for <strong>NACOS</strong>, helping promote student activities and keeping people informed.</p>
  
  <p>Beyond academics, I'm passionate about <strong>design</strong> in all its formsâ€”whether it's creating nail art as a <strong>nail technician</strong> or crafting clean and engaging visuals as a <strong>UI designer</strong>. I also enjoy watching movies, especially Black American films and series.</p>
  
  <p>Right now, I'm interning at <strong>SQI College of ICT</strong> in Ibadan, where I'm learning <strong>Fullstack Development</strong> with a focus on <strong>frontend</strong>. So far, I've learnt:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Why I should aim to be a Software Engineer and not just a Software Developer</li>
    <li>How the internet works</li>
    <li>What a landing page contains</li>
    <li>The different types of elements in HTML</li>
    <li>Various HTML tags, including self-closing tags</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>I love learning, setting goals, and constantly finding new ways to grow. My dream is to make a meaningful impact in tech and inspire others who want to follow a similar path.</p>
