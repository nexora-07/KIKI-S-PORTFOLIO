    <h1>My Favourite Person</h1>
    <p>My favourite person is my mom. She is one of the strongest and most supportive people I know.</p>

  <p>She has always been there for me, encouraging me, praying for me, and helping me become the person I am today. Whether I'm doing well or struggling, she never gives up on me. Her love is constant, and her advice always helps me stay focused.</p>

  <p>I admire her strength, her patience, and how she carries so many responsibilities with so much grace. No matter how busy she is, she always makes time for her family.</p>

  <p>I'm truly blessed to have her in my life. She inspires me every day to work hard, stay kind, and never stop growing.</p>

<br>

  <h2>Things I Love About Her</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>She listens to me without judgment</li>
    <li>She gives the best advice</li>
    <li>She works hard to take care of everyone</li>
    <li>She's very kind and generous</li>
    <li>She makes me feel safe and loved</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What She Has Taught Me</h2>

  <p>I hope to make her proud one day by becoming successful, staying true to myself, and carrying her lessons with me always.</p>
